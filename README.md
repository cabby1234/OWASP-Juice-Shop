# OWASP Juice Shop

<h2>Description</h2>
OWASP Juice Shop is a project that serves as a great platform for testing web application security. It incorporates a wide range of security vulnerabilities inspired by real-world scenarios, making it an ideal playground for penetration testers. The application is built on modern web technologies and includes challenges that cover aspects such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), broken authentication, and more. I have highlighted a few of the vulnerabilites I exploited in the slideshow; along with my overall experience working through Juice Shop.
